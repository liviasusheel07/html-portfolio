<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m <strong>Livia</strong> — an engineering student with a curious mind, a creative soul, and a strong passion for coding. I’ve always believed that the best solutions come from persistence and a love for problem-solving — which is why you’ll often find me deep in code, especially when debugging. There's something exciting about cracking that one bug after hours of thought — it's like solving a mini mystery!</p>

    <p>I completed my schooling at <strong>St. Mary’s School, Pune</strong>, where I built the foundations of my love for technology, science, and innovation. Now, as I pursue my engineering journey, I’m constantly exploring new ways to blend logic with creativity.</p>

    <p>Outside the digital world, I’m a huge nature lover. Whether it’s <strong>trekking through green trails</strong>, <strong>dancing to my favorite beats</strong>, or <strong>diving into a good book</strong>, I find inspiration everywhere — especially in the quiet strength of nature and the rhythm of movement.</p>

    <p>This website is a reflection of who I am — <strong>professional</strong>, yet <strong>friendly</strong>. Focused, yet open to discovery. Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to reach out if you’d like to connect!</p>
